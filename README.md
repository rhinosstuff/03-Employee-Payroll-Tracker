# Employee-Payroll-Tracker

## Description
This is a summary of what I did for the week 3 challenge. I was given an existing starter code with only 3 functions that I needed to implement code for. There were hints and addvice in the README.md, but I had to write the JS code from scratch. 

collectEmployees = function()

    // TODO: Get user input to create and return an array of employee objects  

displayAverageSalary = function(employeesArray)
    
    // TODO: Calculate and display the average salary

getRandomEmployee = function(employeesArray)

    // TODO: Select and display a random employee

## Viewing the challenge

**collectEmployees()** Is viewable once you click the **Add Employees** button and enter data.

To view the output of **displayAverageSalary()** & **getRandomEmployee()** you will need to inspect and view in the console.
